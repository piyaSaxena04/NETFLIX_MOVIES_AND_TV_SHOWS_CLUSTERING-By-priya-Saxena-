# NETFLIX_MOVIES_AND_TV_SHOWS_CLUSTERING-By-priya-Saxena-

This dataset encompasses TV shows and movies accessible on Netflix as of 2019, sourced from Flixable, a third-party Netflix search engine. Notably, a 2018 report from Flixable revealed a substantial surge in the number of Netflix TV shows, nearly tripling since 2010. Concurrently, the count of movies on the streaming service has declined by over 2,000 titles since 2010. This dataset provides an intriguing opportunity to unearth additional insights.

Moreover, integrating this dataset with external data sources like IMDB ratings and Rotten Tomatoes could yield further compelling findings.

The objectives of this project include:

Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to comprehend the types of content available across various countries.
Investigating whether Netflix has been progressively prioritizing TV shows over movies in recent years.
Employing clustering techniques to group similar content based on matching text-based features.
This project promises to unveil valuable insights into Netflix's content evolution and preferences, shedding light on the platform's strategic focus and potential correlations with external rating systems.

Netflix boasts a more extensive collection of movies compared to TV shows within its platform. The predominant genre in Netflix's content library is Drama, closely followed by Comedies and Documentaries. Since its establishment in 2008, Netflix has consistently expanded its content library, demonstrating a steady growth trajectory. The United States takes the lead in producing content available on Netflix, followed by India and the United Kingdom.

To ensure a pristine dataset for analysis, robust techniques were applied to handle missing data in crucial columns such as director, cast, country, and rating. Advanced dimensionality reduction methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were explored to condense features effectively while retaining substantial data variance.

The analysis incorporated clustering algorithms, including k-means and hierarchical clustering, to categorize movies and TV shows based on their unique features. Determination of the optimal number of clusters was achieved by maximizing the silhouette score, revealing deeper insights into inherent patterns and similarities in the dataset.

The emphasis was placed on the business implications of the model, underlining its potential to revolutionize content categorization, enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations, and facilitate targeted marketing strategies for the benefit of Netflix.
